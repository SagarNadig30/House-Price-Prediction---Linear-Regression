This project is a simple implementation of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.

The goal is to build a model that can estimate the price of a house using historical data. It’s a basic machine learning project ideal for beginners who want to understand how regression works.

🔧 What’s Included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Building a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Model evaluation (R² score, Mean Squared Error)

Visualizations for better understanding of data and predictions

🛠 Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn

📁 Dataset:

The dataset contains information about house prices and their features. (Add the source here if it’s from Kaggle or any other platform.)

📌 Objective:

To predict house prices and understand how different features affect the price using a linear approach.
